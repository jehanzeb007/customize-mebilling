                        Medical billing for freestanding emergency rooms and emergency departments comes with its unique set
                        of challenges and issues. High-volume, chaotic, and fast-paced emergency medicine solutions include
                        diagnostic testing as well as multi-specialty services. This is why medical documentation has to be
                        accurate and precise.
                    </p>
                    <p>MeBilling realizes that the medical billing and coding process can be complicated and challenging.
                        Providers have to deal with not only an increased number of patients but various procedural
                        complications and issues like accurately identifying which medical services are eligible for
                        reimbursement and documenting such treatment episodes accurately.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our job is to be transparent and fair with our billing processes and systems. Freestanding emergency
                        rooms have grown quickly over the past couple of years in Texas, Michigan, New York, Illinois, and
                        New Jersey.

                    <p>
                        Freestanding emergency rooms in Texas and Michigan provide a much-needed and valuable resource to
                        surrounding communities, but emergency room services are difficult and tricky to bill.
                    </p>
                    <p>MeBilling is one of the pioneers in this industry and has a full understanding of the nuances and
                        complexities involved in billing and revenue cycle management for emergency care facilities. As this
                        industry is continuing to evolve and change, you should partner with a reliable billing specialist
                        who knows and understands your specific needs and preferences.
